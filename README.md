# ðŸ“¦ AllParcels
This is an app that gathers the freshest copies of all the parcels in Washington State using primary data sources.

# 2020 Parcel Snapshot
The state publishes a yearly parcels snapshot here: 

https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/3dca0b72eae94c098b21329e1e61afd7_0

This project has the same goal, but rather than a one time snapshot this app will give you the freshest parcel data everytime it's run.
